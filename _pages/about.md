I am a recent graduate from the Department of Architecture at the [School of Design](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/en-us), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), having completed my undergraduate studies in June 2023. My research interests are centered around the application of Deep Learning in architecture, focusing on automated generation and optimization in building design.

Academic experiences
======
During my undergraduate studies, I completed two significant academic projects. My first project involved utilizing a genetic algorithm to select and optimize shading strategies. This work has been accepted for publication in the [Journal of Building Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222015388). Following this project, my fascination with dynamic daylight control research grew. I am currently exploring the use of deep learning methods to streamline the process of glare detection. The manuscript related to this research is undergoing major revisions for submission to a top-tier journal in the relevant field.

Current status
======
I am actively seeking a PhD position in fields related to deep learning in the built environment, building design, or 3D building reconstruction. If there are any available opportunities, please feel free to contact me via email.
