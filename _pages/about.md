I am an undergraduated student at Department of architecture, [School of Design](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/en-us), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I will graduate from SJTU in 06.2023 (Expected). My research interests are optimizing the building environment (such as daylit space) and applying machine learning in buildings.

Academic experiences
======
I have two major academic projects during undergraduate studies.  My first work used a genetic algorithm to select and optimize shading strategies. The paper has been accepted for publication in the [Journal of Building Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222015388). After this project, I was fascinated by the research of dynamic daylight control. Traditional glare sensor uses multiple exposure images and requires a great amount of time to process the input to predict glare. I am trying to improve the prediction efficiency by using a single-exposure image to rebuild a luminance map by machine learning. I have finished a major part of this project and a related manuscript is being prepared.
