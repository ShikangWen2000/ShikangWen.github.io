I recently graduated from the Department of Architecture at the [School of Design](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/en-us), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), completing my undergraduate studies in June 2023. My research interests are centered on applying Deep Learning in architecture, with a focus on automated generation and optimization in architectural design and the building environment.

Academic experiences
======
During my undergraduate studies, I completed two significant academic projects. My first project involved utilizing a genetic algorithm to select and optimize shading strategies. This work has been accepted for publication in the [Journal of Building Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222015388). Following this project, my fascination with dynamic daylight control research grew. I am currently exploring the use of deep learning methods to streamline the process of glare detection. The manuscript related to this research had been accepted by Automation in Construction (IF: 10.3).

Additionally, my undergraduate project focused on predicting building energy consumption at a city-scale level and examining how inter-building effects impact the performance of deep learning models in such predictions. I developed an innovative graph neural network to enhance the accuracy of predicting building energy consumption. Currently, I am preparing a manuscript on this study for submission to a top-tier journal.

Current status
======
I am actively seeking a PhD position in fields related to deep learning in the built environment, generative design, or 3D building reconstruction. If there are any available opportunities, please feel free to contact me via email.
